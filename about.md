## Who am I?

[![Me](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/785069861100716032/889331840467492864/me2.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/785069861100716032/889330441461587998/victor.png)

Hey everybody, my name is Victor Vo. I am a photographer from California, trying to find new and interesting things to snap a photo of. I host a blog about how my life is going and photos that I take along the way. I'm a _noob_ in the computer world, and only have dabbed my foot into Linux (I run Arch Linux w/ DWM), and some small web page editing (Jekyll) on the side.
