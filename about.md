## Who am I?

[![Me](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/785069861100716032/889331840467492864/me2.png)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/785069861100716032/889330441461587998/victor.png)

Hey everybody, my name is Victor Vo. I am a photographer and linux hobbyist from California, trying to find new and interesting things to snap a photo of. 

I host a blog about how my life is going and photos that I take along the way (the photos part still needs some work). 

I've been using Arch/Void Linux w/ DWM of 7 years, so suffice to say, I don't think I'm technically a _noob_ anymore, but in terms of technical knowledge of sysadmin commands, I am _not_ the guy to go to for consultation.
