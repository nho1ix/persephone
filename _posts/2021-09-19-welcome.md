Over the past couple of years, I wished that there was a place that I could store my notes as well as thoughts in a format that is able to be consumed by many. I found that there wasn't really an outlet for me to publish my ideas or thoughts as well as a website. I felt that social media should be kept for posting about professional work. I personally prefer to not post about memes or random things on Instagram, as I feel that it is a waste of time for myself and those viewing my page. 

### The process of making my blog

I thought that hosting a website and posting on there would be a good idea, only to actually do it for about a month or 2, and I found that the overhead cost was too much for me. It costed about $4.50 a month to host my website, which generally is pretty cheap, but to me was expenseive since nobody really ever visits my website anyway, so it would be a waste of money. Eventually, I ended up finding out that I could host websites for free with Github Pages, provided I have the files for the layout of the page.
