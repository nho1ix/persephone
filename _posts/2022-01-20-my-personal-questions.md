Now that its the new year, I wanted to make an update to the last post, about my feelings of urgency to do something about the future. College is obviously not in my future, as now that the deadline for colleges and universities have passed, I have essentially closed the door that leads towards college. 

During the two week winter break that we had, I had an extremely depressive period, where I was on my bed with my phone sideways all day. I would get up to do the basic necessities, such as brushing my teeth, showering, eating food, but after that, I would jump straight back into bed like a slob. One thing I would say that helped me get through that depressive period faster than I thought however was to just literally "feel" through the time. Instead of distracting myself with shitty memes or video games or any vice, I just laid there with my shitty feelings. After the two week period however, I noticed a change. I'd say this change really helped me sort my life together and start making the changes to my life that future me would be happy about. I began to care less about things I'd usually worry about. Things that would feel nervous to me like presenting now was as easy as talking to a teacher. It honestly felt like I was flowing down with the River of Life, instead of against it. 

I made this blog post to list out the things that I have on my mind about what I want to think about or do in the future. Maybe they will help someone in a similar situation as I am.

1. What are my plans after high school?
  - Whether to use the money I amassed across my 4 years of high school to buy a car or to save it and use it for something else?
2. Creating a timetable for my day
3. Treating my memory issues
4. Figuring out how to retain the knowledge gained after reading books
