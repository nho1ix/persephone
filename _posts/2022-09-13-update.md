It has been about 9 months since my last post. To be honest, I had plans to use this blog more frequently, but laziness crept over me, and I ended up not using it at all. Depending on how it goes, either I might seriously start using this blog again, which I've never really started, but hey, never too late to start üòù, or just stop using it again for a long period of time. 

In any case, I wanted to talk about the more important parts of what I was planning to do recently. I've already told my mom a couple days ago that I wasn't going to college. Albeit sad news, I do have a plan:

1. Get a job
2. Study coding while on the job
3. Envision a [best-case/worst-case] scenario for my life
4. Hopefully settle down in a year's time
5. Get my driver's license
6. Maybe reconnect with friends more
7. Re-start doing dual n-back

I think with how things are going, it's not very certain if this will be the way I'm conducting my plans, but it's better than nothing for now. Most of my plans tend to really just be on the spot spontaneous plans. 

I think what I can start doing, is starting to create deadlines for when I should complete The Odin Project course. With big milestones broken down into smaller weekly and daily chunks, it should be a good visual way to see how much progress I am making. I could also use these blog formatted posts to keep track of the knowledge I've gathered, as well as any other thoughts I come up with. 

One of the novel things about journaling is the actual physical contact with the pen and paper that I just don't get with typing into a blog, ironically. I wish I was able to journal or write faster and neater, or just memorize things better I guess. Maybe I should also look into restarting dual n-back (let me put this as #7 on the list). My memory is conventionally terrible.

In any case, it's time to wrap up this post. Hopefully, I'll continue to update it.
